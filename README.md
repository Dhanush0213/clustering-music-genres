"Clustering Music Genres using Python" project: Analyzing diverse music dataset, applying clustering algorithms to group genres based on shared characteristics, and visualizing results for insights.

Clustering Music Genres using Python
This project aims to cluster music genres by applying clustering techniques to a dataset of songs. The goal is to explore relationships and similarities between different music genres using Python programming language.

Project Structure:
data/: Contains the dataset of music tracks in CSV format.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step code and explanations.
1_data_preprocessing.ipynb: Data collection and preprocessing.
2_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
3_clustering.ipynb: Applying clustering algorithms and evaluating results.
reports/: Generated reports and visualizations.
README.md: Project description and instructions.


Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Usage:
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in each notebook to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and clustering analysis.
Generate visualizations and reports in the reports/ directory.

Dataset:
The dataset contains a collection of music tracks with features such as tempo, duration, energy, pitch, and timbre. The data has been preprocessed for ease of analysis.

Results:
The project aims to identify clusters of music genres based on shared characteristics. The clustering results and insights can be found in the notebooks and reports generated during the analysis.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different clustering algorithms, and contribute to further enhancements of the project.
